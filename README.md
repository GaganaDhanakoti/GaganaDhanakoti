I’m a Machine Learning Engineer and Software Developer currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at Georgia Tech (graduating Dec 2026). My focus areas are **AI/ML**, **NLP**, and **cloud-native applications**.


## 🔹 About Me
- 🌱 Passionate about applying AI/ML to solve real-world problems.
- 💻 Experienced in **Python, Java, C++, TensorFlow, PyTorch, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes**.
- 🤝 I’ve worked on large-scale **enterprise ML systems** and **academic research projects**.
- 📚 Active learner of distributed systems, deep learning, and ethical AI.

## 🔹 Public Projects
*(Selected examples showcasing my skills — using public data and open-source tech stacks)*  
- 🧠 **[Yet to upload]**  

<!--
⚡ **[Project Name]** – e.g., Scalable ML API (FastAPI + Docker + Kubernetes).  
🔍 **[Project Name]** – e.g., Bias Mitigation Toolkit (Public datasets).  

-->

## 🔹 Confidential Projects
Some of my most impactful work was done during **internships** and **graduate research** under **strict NDAs**.  
Because of confidentiality:  
- I share **public-friendly demos** instead of full implementations.  
- These demos still reflect my **technical depth and problem-solving approach**.

## 🔹 Tech Stack
`Python` • `Java` • `C++` • `TensorFlow` • `PyTorch` • `AWS` • `Docker` • `Kubernetes` • `FastAPI` • `SQL/NoSQL` • `LLMs`
